Evolve Simple Sorting Algorithms Implemented in a Variety of Languages

This repository contains four sorting algorithms implemented in four
programming languages each.  Every implementation compiles to an
command line executable which implements the same simple
specification.  All implementations may be tested using the same test
script in bin/test.sh.

Contents

  sorters | implementations of 4 sorting algorithsm in 4 langauges
      bin | lisp programs and shell scripts for running experiments
          | and collecting and analyzing results
   README | this file
    NOTES | additional informal notes

Requirements

  Many of the experiments laid out in bin may require either the
  genprog [1] or software evolution [2] tool suites.  Some of the
  simpler experiments may only require the cil-mutate [3] or
  clang-mutate [4] executables.
